# rotten-tomatoes
analyse movie/reviewer data and recommend the movie which you should watch next

There are a lot of movies in the world.
Good movies give people an excitement, some new ideas, and deep understanding to things.
However, I hate to waste of time to watch boring movies.
So I develop movie recommendation program to analyse rotten-tomatoes review data with python.

This project includes 
1. Scrayping rotten-tomatoes review data with beautiful soup
2. Visualizing data
3. Clustering the reviewer including myself
